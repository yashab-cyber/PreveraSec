# Phase 2: Identity & Auth Orchestration

## üéØ Goals
**Reliable auth handling across roles and flows.**

## üìã Work Requirements

### Core Components
1. **Credential Vault + Test-Account Seeder**
   - Secure credential storage and management
   - Automated test account generation and seeding
   - Environment-specific credential isolation

2. **OAuth/OIDC Device/Code Flows**
   - OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow
   - OpenID Connect integration
   - Device authorization grant flow
   - PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) support

3. **Session Management**
   - Session refresh mechanisms
   - Token lifecycle management
   - Session state persistence

4. **CSRF Protection**
   - CSRF token capture and validation
   - Cross-origin request handling
   - State parameter management

5. **MFA Test Bypass (Staging)**
   - Multi-factor authentication simulation
   - Test environment MFA bypass
   - MFA flow validation

6. **Anti-Automation Safeties**
   - Rate limiting and throttling
   - Bot detection mechanisms
   - CAPTCHA handling strategies

7. **Multi-Actor Context Pool**
   - Role-based context management (guest/user/admin/vendor)
   - Dynamic token swapping mid-flow
   - Context isolation and switching

## üöÄ Deliverables

### Definition of Done (DoD)
- ‚úÖ **Deterministic login for all roles** - Consistent authentication across user types
- ‚úÖ **Token rotation stability >99% across 24h runs** - Robust long-running authentication
